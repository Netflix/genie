We're happy to finally update the Genie website for the impending release of
Genie 3.0.0. There's been a lot of hard work done to improve Genie for 3.0.0
so it's only fitting that there is a shiny new coat of paint on the website
to match. We'll be adding content as we get closer to the OSS release.

Hope you like it!

As a reminder here is how this place used to look:

Slight improvement?
