== {revnumber} Release Notes

The following are the release notes for Genie {revnumber}.

=== Features

* Complete database schema and interaction code re-write for more normalization
** Allows more insights into job and user behavior by breaking apart large JSON blobs and other denormalized fields
** Improved cluster selection algorithm to speed up selection
** Projections on tables improve data transfer speeds
** Merge jobs tables to reduce duplicate data
** Surrogate primary keys for improved join performance and space usage vs. Sting based external unique ids
* New fields added to jobs
** `grouping`
*** A way to provide search for jobs related to each other. E.g. The name of an entire workflow in a job scheduler can
be set in this field to provide way to find all the jobs related to this workflow
*** Added to search API as optional field
** `groupingInstance`
*** Building on `grouping` this provides a field for the unique instance of the grouping e.g. the run identifier of the
workflow
*** Added to search API as optional field
* New field(s) added to Job Request, Job, Cluster, Command, Application
** `metadata`
*** Allows users to insert any additional metadata they wish to these resources. *MUST* be valid JSON.
*** Stored as blob so no search available. Meant for use by higher level systems to take metadata and parse it
themselves for use in building up business use cases (lineage, relationships, etc) that the Genie data model doesn't
support natively

=== Upgrade Instructions

https://flywaydb.org/[Flyway] will upgrade the database schema for you. Due to performance reasons at large
scale, the data for jobs are not copied over between versions by default. Data for applications, commands and clusters
are copied so as not to interrupt operation. If you desire to copy over your old job data the tables were copied over
into {tableName}_old and for
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Netflix/genie/v{revnumber}/genie-ddl/src/main/sql/mysql/load-3.2.x-job-data-to-3.3.0.mysql.sql[MySQL]
and
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Netflix/genie/v{revnumber}/genie-ddl/src/main/sql/postgresql/load-3.2.x-job-data-to-3.3.0.postgresql.sql[PostgreSQL]
scripts exist to copy over the job data. You can execute these scripts on your database and they should be able to run
while your application is active and copy over data in the background.

NOTE: If you run the data movement scripts it will remove the old tables. If you don't they will sit in your schema.
The next major Genie release will remove these tables in their schema upgrade scripts if they still exist. Feel free to
drop them yourself if they're no longer needed.

=== Library Upgrades

* Upgrade Spring Boot to {springBootVersion}
* Upgrade to Spring Platform IO {springPlatformVersion} for library dependency management
** http://docs.spring.io/platform/docs/{springPlatformVersion}/reference/htmlsingle/[Reference Docs]
* Upgrade to Spring Cloud {springCloudVersion} for cloud dependency management
** http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/{springCloudVersion}/[Reference Docs]

== 3.2.0 Release Notes

The following are the release notes for Genie 3.2.0.

=== Upgrade Instructions

If upgrading from existing 3.1.x installation run appropriate database upgrade script:

* https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Netflix/genie/v3.2.0/genie-ddl/src/main/sql/mysql/upgrade-3.1.x-to-3.2.0.mysql.sql[mysql]
* https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Netflix/genie/v3.2.0/genie-ddl/src/main/sql/postgresql/upgrade-3.1.x-to-3.2.0.postgresql.sql[postgresql]

This *must* be done before deploying the 3.2.0 binary or Flyway will break. Going forward this will no longer be
necessary and Genie binary will package upgrade scripts and Flyway will apply them automatically.

Once the script is run you can deploy the 3.2.0 binary. Once successfully deployed in your db schema you should see a
new table `schema_version`. Do not delete or modify this table it is used by Flyway to manage upgrades.
