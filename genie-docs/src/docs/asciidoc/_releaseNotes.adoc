== {revnumber} Release Notes

The following are the release notes for Genie {revnumber}.

== 4.0.0 Release Notes

=== Major differences between 3.x and 4.x

 * Distributed execution - jobs are no longer restricted to execute on a Genie instance host
 ** All jobs are executed via agent: a standalone process which takes ownership of a job, executes it, and reports updates back to the server via gRPC
 * Job execution CLI - jobs can be launched outside of the Genie cluster via command-line interface
 * Resource selection criteria - allow for additional criteria in addition to matching based on tags
 * Resource resolution - provide a more flexible and customizable way to select command and cluster for a job
 ** Command can specify cluster criteria, removing the need for explicit 1:1 mapping between the two entities
 ** Command selected based on job command criteria. Cluster selected based on the combination of job and command cluster criteria
 ** Pluggable resolution logic for advanced usage (in the form of Groovy scripts)
 * Long-term job output archival - archive job outputs outside the cluster
 ** Customizable filtering of archived files
 ** Explicit tracking of archival status, surfaced via API
 * Job status change notifications
 * Explicit tracking of job archival status
 * Zookeeper-based cluster membership (for request routing) and leader election
 * Pagination of results in Java Genie client
 * Based on Spring Boot 2.3.x

== 3.3.0 Release Notes

The following are the release notes for Genie 3.3.0.

* Complete database schema and interaction code re-write for more normalization
** Allows more insights into job and user behavior by breaking apart large JSON blobs and other denormalized fields
** Improved cluster selection algorithm to speed up selection
** Projections on tables improve data transfer speeds
** Merge jobs tables to reduce duplicate data
** Surrogate primary keys for improved join performance and space usage vs. Sting based external unique ids
* New fields added to jobs
** `grouping`
*** A way to provide search for jobs related to each other. E.g. The name of an entire workflow in a job scheduler can
be set in this field to provide way to find all the jobs related to this workflow
*** Added to search API as optional field
** `groupingInstance`
*** Building on `grouping` this provides a field for the unique instance of the grouping e.g. the run identifier of the
workflow
*** Added to search API as optional field
* New field(s) added to Job Request, Job, Cluster, Command, Application
** `metadata`
*** Allows users to insert any additional metadata they wish to these resources. *MUST* be valid JSON.
*** Stored as blob so no search available. Meant for use by higher level systems to take metadata and parse it
themselves for use in building up business use cases (lineage, relationships, etc) that the Genie data model doesn't
support natively
* Switch to http://h2database.com/html/main.html[H2] for in memory database
* Turn on Hibernate schema validation at boot

=== Upgrade Instructions

https://flywaydb.org/[Flyway] will upgrade the database schema for you. Due to performance reasons at large
scale, the data for jobs are not copied over between versions by default. Data for applications, commands and clusters
are copied so as not to interrupt operation. If you desire to copy over your old job data the tables were copied over
into {tableName}_old and for
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Netflix/genie/v3.3.0/genie-ddl/src/main/sql/mysql/load-3.2.x-job-data-to-3.3.0.mysql.sql[MySQL]
and
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Netflix/genie/v3.3.0/genie-ddl/src/main/sql/postgresql/load-3.2.x-job-data-to-3.3.0.postgresql.sql[PostgreSQL]
scripts exist to copy over the job data. You can execute these scripts on your database and they should be able to run
while your application is active and copy over data in the background.

NOTE: If you run the data movement scripts it will remove the old tables. If you don't they will sit in your schema.
The next major Genie release will remove these tables in their schema upgrade scripts if they still exist. Feel free to
drop them yourself if they're no longer needed.

=== Library Upgrades

* Upgrade Spring Boot to {springBootVersion}
* Upgrade to Spring Cloud {springCloudVersion} for cloud dependency management
** http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/{springCloudVersion}/[Reference Docs]

== 3.2.0 Release Notes

The following are the release notes for Genie 3.2.0.

=== Upgrade Instructions

If upgrading from existing 3.1.x installation run appropriate database upgrade script:

* https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Netflix/genie/v3.2.0/genie-ddl/src/main/sql/mysql/upgrade-3.1.x-to-3.2.0.mysql.sql[mysql]
* https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Netflix/genie/v3.2.0/genie-ddl/src/main/sql/postgresql/upgrade-3.1.x-to-3.2.0.postgresql.sql[postgresql]

This *must* be done before deploying the 3.2.0 binary or Flyway will break. Going forward this will no longer be
necessary and Genie binary will package upgrade scripts and Flyway will apply them automatically.

Once the script is run you can deploy the 3.2.0 binary. Once successfully deployed in your db schema you should see a
new table `schema_version`. Do not delete or modify this table it is used by Flyway to manage upgrades.
