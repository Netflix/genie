== Metrics

The following is an extensive list of metrics (counters, timers, gauges, ...)
published organically by Genie, in addition to metrics published by Spring, JVM
and system metrics and statistics.

Metrics are collected using http://micrometer.io/[Micrometer] which allows system admins to plugin a variety of backend
collection systems (Atlas, Datadog, Graphite, Ganglia, etc). See http://micrometer.io/[website] for more details. Genie
ships with no backend system compiled in. It will have to be added if one is desired otherwise metrics are just
published within the local JVM and available on the Actuator `/metrics` endpoint.
