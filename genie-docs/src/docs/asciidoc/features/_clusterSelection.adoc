=== Cluster Selection

Genie allows administrators to tag clusters with multiple tags that could reflect any type of domain modeling the
admins wish to accomplish. Purpose of the cluster, types of data the cluster can access, workload expected are just
some examples of ways tags could be used to classify clusters. Users submit jobs with a series of tags that help
Genie identify which cluster to run a job on. Sometimes the tags submitted by the job match multiple clusters. At this
point Genie needs a mechanism to chose a final runtime target from the set of clusters selected. This is where the
cluster selection feature of Genie comes into play.

Genie has an interface `ClusterSelector` which can be implemented to provide plugin functionality of algorithms for
cluster selection. The interface has a single method:

[source,java]
----
/**
 * Return best cluster to run job on.
 *
 * @param clusters   An immutable, non-empty list of available clusters to choose from
 * @param jobRequest The job request these clusters are being considered for
 * @return the "best" cluster to run job on or null if no cluster selected
 * @throws GenieException if there is any error
 */
@Nullable
Cluster selectCluster(final List<Cluster> clusters, final JobRequest jobRequest) throws GenieException;
----

At startup Genie will collect all beans that implement the `ClusterSelector` interface and based on their order
store them in an invocation order list. Meaning that when multiple clusters are selected from the database based on tags
Genie will send the list of clusters to the implementations in preference order until one of them returns the cluster to
use.

Genie currently ships with two implementations of this interface which are described below.

==== RandomizedClusterSelectorImpl

As the name indicates this selector simply uses a random number generator to select a cluster from the list by
index. There is no intelligence to this selection algorithm but it does provide very close to an equal distribution
between clusters if the same tags are always used.

This implementation is the "default" implementation. It has the lowest priority order so if all other active
implementations fail to select a cluster this implementation will be invoked and chose randomly.

==== ScriptClusterSelector

This implementation, first introduced in 3.1.0, allows administrators to provide a script to be invoked at runtime to
decide which cluster to select. Currently `JavaScript` and `Groovy` are supported out of the box but others (like
`Python`, `Ruby`, etc) could be supported by adding their implementations of the
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/script/ScriptEngine.html[ScriptEngine] interface to the Genie classpath.

===== Configuration

The script selector is disabled by default. To enable it an admin must set the property
`genie.scripts.cluster-selector.source` to a valid script URI (e.g.: `file:///myscript.js`,
`classpath:org/my/package/myscript.groovy`, `s3://my-app/scripts/myscript.js`).
It is also recommended to set `genie.scripts.cluster-selector.auto-load-enabled` to `true` to enable eager loading
of the script (default behavior is to load and compile lazily).



Other properties:

|===
|Property |Description| Default Value

|genie.scripts.cluster-selector.source
|URI of the script to load. `ScriptClusterSelector` is enabled only if this property is set.
|null

|genie.scripts.cluster-selector.auto-load-enabled
|If true, the script eagerly load during startup, as opposed to lazily load on first use.
|false

|genie.scripts.cluster-selector.timeout
|Maximum script execution time (in milliseconds). After this time has elapsed, evaluation is shut down.
|5000

|===

See also `genie.scripts-manager.*` properties, which affect this component.


===== Script Contract

The contract between the script and the Java code is as follows:

.Script Inputs
|===
|Parameter |Description

|clusters
|Non-empty JSON array of cluster objects (serialized as a string) of the clusters to be evaluated

|jobRequest
|JSON object (serialized as a string) of the job request that kicked off this evaluation

|===

.Script Output
|===
|Result |Description

|A string
|The id of the cluster selected by the script algorithm that should be used to run the job

|null
|No cluster was selected and the evaluation should fall back to another selector algorithm

|===

For most of the script engines the last statement will be the return value.

===== Script Examples

Some simple script examples

====== Javascript

[source,javascript]
----
var cJson = JSON.parse(clusters);
var jJson = JSON.parse(jobRequest);

var index;
for (index = 0; index < cJson.length; index++) {
    var cluster = cJson[index];
    if (cluster.user === "h") {
        break;
    }
}

index < cJson.length ? cJson[index].id : null;
----

====== Groovy

[source,groovy]
----
import groovy.json.JsonSlurper

def jsonSlurper = new JsonSlurper()
def cJson = jsonSlurper.parseText(clusters)
def jJson = jsonSlurper.parseText(jobRequest)

def index = cJson.findIndexOf {
    cluster -> cluster.user == "h"
}

index == -1 ? null : cJson[index].id
----

===== Caveats

The script selector provides great flexibility for system administrators to test algorithms for cluster load
balancing at runtime. Since the script is refreshed periodically it can even be changed after Genie is running. With
this flexibility comes the trade off that script evaluation is going to be slower than code running direct JVM byte
code. The selector tries to offset this by compiling and caching the script code in between refresh invocations. It
is recommended that once an algorithm is well tested it be converted to a true implementation of the
`ClusterSelector` interface if performance is desired.

Additionally if a script error is made the `ScriptClusterSelector` will swallow the exceptions and simply return `null`
from all calls to `selectCluster` until the script is fixed and `refresh` is invoked again. The metric
`genie.jobs.clusters.selectors.script.select.timer` with tag `status` and value `failed` can be used to monitor
this situation.

Two more metrics are relevant in this context.
`genie.scripts.load.timer` timer for scripts loading (and reloading) can also be used to monitor unavailable resources,
 compilation errors, etc.
`genie.scripts.evaluate.timer` timer for script evaluation, can also be used to monitor evaluation errors, timeouts, etc.
Both metrics are tagged with `scriptUri` in case multiple scripts are loaded.

==== Wrap Up

This section went over the cluster selection feature of Genie. This interface provides an extension point for
administrators of Genie to tweak Genie's runtime behavior to suit their needs.
