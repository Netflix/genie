=== Security

A long requested feature for Genie has been adding authentication and authorization support for the UI and particularly
the REST APIs. Genie 3 development allowed the time and resources to finally implement a solution. Genie security is
built on top of https://projects.spring.io/spring-security/[Spring Security] which allows the specific security
solution to be plugged in based on user requirements.

==== Architecture

Out of the box Genie supports securing the REST APIs via OAuth2 and/or x509 certificates and the UI via SAML. Below is
an image of how this security architecture works within Netflix.

At a high level you can see that the requests are passed through several security filter chains before they arrive at
the Genie application code. Based on the URL being accessed different filter chains will be triggered. If the request
can be authenticated and authorized the security configuration is stored within the Spring Security Context which can
then be accessed via Genie code if necessary.

All the security can be enabled or disabled as desired by system administrators. You can find the various properties
under `genie.security.*` in the <<Properties>> section. Spring specific properties are also involved but the enabling
and disabling is done via the `genie.security` properties.

==== REST API Security

The REST APIs described in the https://netflix.github.io/genie/releases/{revnumber}/rest/[REST documentation] can be
secured via OAuth2 and/or x509 out of the box. Both these mechanisms secure everything under `/api/*` to require a user
be authenticated to access them. All `job` and read (e.g. GET) APIs are available to any authenticated user when
security is enabled. If security is enabled users will need to be granted an `admin` role in order to use the
configuration APIs for `applications`, `commands` and `clusters`. By configuration APIs we mean anything that will
modify the state of these resources like the POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE APIs.

===== x509

If x509 is enabled it will be checked first (before the OAuth2 filter chain if that is enabled) and if a valid
certificate is present in the request the user will be authenticated and granted the pertinent role.

For this to work out of the box the certicates must be formatted so that the `principle` field contains a colon
separated string of format `{user}:{role1,role2...}`. This is how Genie will determine the user and roles that user
will be granted within the system.

===== OAuth2

https://oauth.net/2/[OAuth2] security is implemented via the
https://projects.spring.io/spring-security-oauth/[Spring Security OAuth] project. You can read documentation there but
out of the box support has been extended to include Ping Federate as a provider. This is used within Netflix and there
are two ways you can have Genie validate tokens. One is if the Bearer token is merely and identifier you can have
Genie call the Ping Federate server to validate the Bearer token is valid. The other is to configure Ping Federate to
generated https://jwt.io/[JWT] tokens and all validation can be done within the Genie node. This is the preferrable
option as you save processing time and unnecessary IO.

==== UI Security

The UI and other endpoints can be secured using SAML via https://projects.spring.io/spring-security-saml/[Spring SAML].
You can configure Genie where to look in the SAML assertion to parse out user and role information. If only SAML
security is turned on users won't need to authenticate in order to access the APIs. If SAML and one of the REST API
security methods is enabled and configured if a user authenticates to the UI via SAML they will also be able to access
the REST APIs within the same HTTP session without aquiring a token or passing a certificate.

==== Wrap Up

This section is meant to provide a high level overview of how Genie supports authentication and authorization out of
the box if configured properly. Security is a very large topic and to truly understand how this works reading into
the various libraries and technologies mentioned in this section is recommended.
