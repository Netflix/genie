=== Netflix Example

Understanding Genie without a concrete example is hard. This section attempts to walk through an end to end
configuration and job execution example of a job at Netflix. To see more examples or try your own please see the
https://netflix.github.io/genie/docs/{revnumber}/demo/[Demo Guide]. Also see the
https://netflix.github.io/genie/docs/{revnumber}/rest/[REST API] documentation which will describe the purpose of the
fields of the resources shown below.

NOTE: This example contains JSON representations of resources.

==== Configuration

For the purpose of brevity we will only cover a subset of the total Netflix
configuration.

===== Clusters

At Netflix there are tens of active clusters available at any given time. For this example we'll focus on the
production (SLA) and adhoc http://hadoop.apache.org/[Hadoop] YARN clusters and the production
https://prestodb.io[Presto] cluster. For the Hadoop clusters we launch using
https://aws.amazon.com/emr/[Amazon EMR] but it really shouldn't matter how clusters are launched provided you can
access the proper `*site.xml` files.

The process of launching a YARN cluster at Netflix involves a set of Python tools which interact with the Amazon and
Genie APIs. First these tools use the EMR APIs to launch the cluster based on configuration files for the cluster
profile. Then the cluster site XML files are uploaded to S3. Once this is complete all the metadata is sent to Genie to
create a cluster resource which you can see examples of below.

Presto clusters are launched using http://www.spinnaker.io/[Spinnaker] on regular EC2 instances. As part of the
pipeline the metadata is registered with Genie using the aforementioned Python tools, which in turn leverage the OSS
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nflx-genie-client[Genie Python Client].

In the following cluster resources you should note the `tags` applied to each cluster. Remember that the `genie.id` and
`genie.name` tags are automatically applied by Genie but all other tags are applied by the admin.

For the YARN clusters note that all the configuration files are referenced by their S3 locations. These files are
downloaded into the job working directory at runtime.

===== Commands

Commands and applications at Netflix are handled a bit differently than clusters. The source data for these command and
application resources are not generated dynamically like the cluster configuration files. Instead they are stored in a
git repository as a combination of YAML, bash, python and other files. These configuration files are synced to an S3
bucket every time a commit occurs. This makes sure Genie is always pulling in the latest configuration. This sync is
performed by a Jenkins job responding to a commit hook trigger. Also done in this Jenkins job is registration of the
commands and applications with Genie via the same python tool set and Genie python client as with clusters.

Pay attention to the tags applied to the commands as they are used to select which command to use when a job is run.
The presto command includes a setup file which allows additional configuration when it is used.

===== Applications

Below are the applications needed by the above commands. The most important part of these applications are the
dependencies and the setup file.

The dependencies are effectively the installation package and at Netflix typically are a zip of all binaries needed to
run a client like Hadoop, Hive, Spark etc. Some of these  zips are generated by builds and placed in S3 and others are
downloaded from OSS projects and uploaded to S3 periodically. Often minor changes to these dependencies are needed. A
new file is uploaded to S3 and the Genie caches on each node will be refreshed with this new file on next access. This
pattern allows us to avoid upgrade of Genie clusters every time an application changes.

The setup file effectively is the installation script for the aforementioned dependencies. It is sourced by Genie and
the expectation is that after it is run the application is successfully configured in the job working directory.

===== Relationships

Now that all the resources are available they need to be linked together. Commands need to be added to the clusters
they can be run on and applications need to be added as dependencies for commands.

====== Commands for a Cluster

When commands are added to a cluster they should be in priority order. Meaning if two commands both match a users tags
for a job the one higher in the list will be used. This allows us to switch defaults quickly and transparently.

Note: The lists below leave out a lot of commands and fields for brevity. Only the id of the command is included so it
can reference the same command resource defined earlier in this article.

*Hadoop Prod Cluster*

The Hadoop clusters have both currently supported Spark versions added. Spark 1.6.1 is the default but users can
override to Spark 2 using the `ver` tag.

Note: https://genieHost/api/v3/clusters/bdp_h2prod_20161217_205111/commands

====== Applications for a Command

Linking applications to a command tells Genie that these applications need to be downloaded and setup in order to
successfully run the command. The order of the applications will be the order the download and setup is performed so
dependencies between applications should be managed via this order.

*Presto 0.149*

Presto only needs the corresponding Presto application which contains the Presto Java CLI jar and some setup wrapper
scripts.

*Spark Submit Prod 1.6.1*

Since we submit Spark jobs to YARN clusters in order to run the Spark submit commands we need both Spark and Hadoop
applications installed and configured on the job classpath in order to run. Hadoop needs to be setup first so that
the configurations can be copied to Spark.

==== Job Submission

Everything is now in place for users to submit their jobs. This section will walk through the components and outputs of
that process. For clarity we're going to show a PySpark job being submitted to show how Genie figures out the cluster
and command to be used based on what was configured above.

===== The Request

Below is an actual job request (with a few obfuscations) made by a production job here at Netflix to Genie.

----

Lets look at a few of the fields of note:

<1> The user set the ID. This is a popular pattern in Netflix for tracking jobs between systems and reattaching to jobs.
<2> The user added a few tags that will allow them to search for the job later. This is optional but convenient.
<3> The user specifies some arguments to add to the default set of command arguments specified by the command
`executable` field. In this case it's what python file to run.
<4> The user wants this job to run on any cluster that is labeled as having an SLA which also supports the command
selected using the `commandCriteria`
<5> User wants the default Spark Submit command (no version specified) and wants to be able to access production data
<6> Here you can see that they add the two files referenced in the `commandArgs` as dependencies. These files will be
downloaded in the root job directory parallel to the run script so they are accessible.

===== *The Job*

In this case the job was accepted by Genie for processing. Below is the actual job object containing fields the user
might care about. Some are copied from the initial request (like tags) and some are added by Genie.

Some fields of note:

<1> The current status of the job. Since this sample was taken after the job was completed it's already marked
SUCCESSFUL
<2> This job was successful but if it failed for some reason a more human readable reason would be found here
<3> The time this job was forked from the Genie process
<4> The time Genie recognized the job as complete
<5> Where Genie uploaded a zip of the job directory after the job was completed
<6> The name of the cluster where this job ran and is de-normalized from the cluster record at the time
<7> The name of the command used to run this job which is de-normalized from the command record at the time
<8> The total run time in ISO8601

====== Cluster Selection

Because the user submitted with `sched:sla` this limits the clusters it can run on to any with that tag applied. In our
example case only the cluster with ID `bdp_h2prod_20161217_205111` has this tag. This isn't enough to make sure this
job can run (there also needs to be a matching command). If there had been multiple sla clusters Genie would consider
them all equal and randomly select one.

====== Command Selection

The command criteria states that this job needs to run on a SLA cluster that supports a command of type
`prodsparksubmit` that can access `prod` data. Two commands (`prodsparksubmit161` and `prodsparksubmit200`) match this
criteria. Both are linked to the cluster `bdp_h2prod_20161217_205111`. Since both match Genie selects the "default" one
which is the first on in the list. In this case it was `prodsparksubmit161`.

===== The Job Execution

Below is the job execution resource. This is mainly for system and admin use but it can have some useful information
for users as well. Mainly it shows which Genie node it actually ran on, how much memory it was allocated, how
frequently the system polled it for status and when it would have timed out had it kept running.

===== Job Output

Below is an image of the root of the job output directory (displayed via Genie UI) for the above job. Note that the
dependency files are all downloaded there and some standard files are available (run, stdout, stderr).

NOTE: The URI's in this section point to the UI output endpoint however they are also available via the REST API and
the UI is really calling this REST API to get the necessary information. Showing the UI endpoints for the better
looking output and because most users will see this version.

====== The Run Script

Clicking into the run script shows the below contents. This run script is generated specifically for each individual
job by Genie. It has some standard bits (error checking, exit process) but also specific information like environment
variables and what to actually run. Everything is specific to the job working directory. In particular note all the
`GENIE_*` environment variable exports. These can be used when building your setup and configuration scripts to be more
flexible.

====== Genie Dir

Inside the output directory there is a `genie` directory. This directory is where Genie stores all the downloaded
dependencies and any logs. Everything outside this directory is intended to be user generated other than the run
script. Some commands or applications may put their logs in the root directory as well if desired (like spark or hive
logs).

variables that were available right before Genie executed the final command to run the job in the run script.

==== Wrap Up

This section went over how Genie is configured by admins at Netflix and how how users submit
jobs and retrieve their logs and output. Anyone is free to configure Genie however suits their needs in terms of
tags and applications which are downloaded vs installed already on a Genie node but this method works for us here at
Netflix.
