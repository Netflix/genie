=== Netflix Deployment

Many people ask how Genie is deployed at Netflix on AWS. This section tries to explain at a high level the components
used and how Genie integrates into the environment. Below is a diagram of how deployment looks at Netflix.

==== Components

Brief descriptions of all the components.

===== Elastic Load Balancer

The https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/[Elastic Load Balancer] (ELB) is used for a few purposes.

* Allow a single endpoint for all API calls
* Distribute API calls amongst all Genie nodes in an ASG
* Allow HTTPS termination at single point
* Allow human friendly DNS name to be assigned via https://aws.amazon.com/route53/[Route 53] entry

===== Auto Scaling Group (ASG)

A cluster of Genie nodes. Each http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html[AMI] contains an Apache
HTTP server fronting Tomcat 8 via http://tomcat.apache.org/connectors-doc/index.html[AJP].

Currently the Genie ASG is a fleet of http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/i2-instances.html[i2.4xl]
instances. The primary production ASG sizes about thirty instances at any given time. Each Genie instance is configured
to be allocated 80% of the available system memory for jobs. Tomcat itself is given 10 GB. Leaving the rest for the
system and other processes.

The ASG is set to auto scale when the average amount of used job memory, that 80% of the system memory, exceeds 60% of
the available.

For example an i2.4xl image has 122 GB of available memory. For simplicity we allocate 100 GB for jobs. If the average
memory used for jobs per node across the ASG exceeds 60 GB for some period of time we will scale the cluster up by
one node to allocate resources before we get in trouble.

Currently we don't auto scale down but from time to time we take a look to see if a new ASG needs to be launched at a
smaller size.

===== Relational Database (RDS)

We currently use an https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/[Amazon Aurora] cluster on db.r3.4xl instances. Aurora is MySQL
compatible so we use the standard MySQL JDBC driver that is packaged with Genie to talk to the database. We deploy to
a Multi-AZ cluster and we have a reader endpoint that we use for reporting and backup.

===== Zookeeper

We use an https://zookeeper.apache.org/[Apache Zookeeper] cluster which is deployed and managed by another team within
Netflix for leadership election within our Genie ASG. When the Genie ASG comes up it (using Spring Cloud Cluster) looks
in Zookeeper to see if there already is a leader for the app/cluster/stack combination. If there isn't it elects a new
one.

===== ElastiCache

We use https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/[AWS ElastiCache] to provide a Redis cluster to store our HTTP sessions (via
http://projects.spring.io/spring-session/[Spring Session]). This allows us to have the users only sign in via SAML one
time and not have to do it every time the ELB routes them to a new host for the UI.

===== Security Configuration

Internally Genie is secured via OAuth2 (for APIs) and SAML (for UI). We integrate with a Ping Federate IDP service to
provide authentication and authorization information.

HTTPS is enabled to the ELB via a Verisign signed certificate tied to the Route 53 DNS address.

See <<Security>> for more information.

===== Spinnaker

Genie is deployed using http://www.spinnaker.io/[Spinnaker]. We currently have a few stacks (prod, test, dev, load,
stage, etc) that we use for different purposes. Spinnaker handles all this for us after we configure the pipelines.
See the Spinnaker site for more information.

==== Wrap Up

This section focussed on how Genie is deployed within Netflix. Hopefully it helps bring clarity to a way that Genie can
be deployed. Genie certainly is not limited to this deployment model and you are free to come up with your own this
should only serve as a template or example.
