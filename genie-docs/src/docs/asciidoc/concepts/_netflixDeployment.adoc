=== Netflix Deployment

This section gives an overview of how Genie is configured and deployed at Netflix.

==== Genie OSS vs Genie Netflix

Genie leverages Spring Boot to enable customization for our internal deployment, allowing deep integration with the rest of the internal Netflix ecosystem.

Some examples of the additional component we use:

 - https://github.com/Netflix/eureka[Eureka] for service discovery and routing
 - https://github.com/Netflix/atlas[Atlas] for metrics
 - https://github.com/Netflix/archaius[Archaius] for dynamic configuration
 - https://netflix.github.io/titus/[Titus] for job containers
 - And many other Netflix-internal components related to security, monitoring, observability, log indexing, etc.

We augment the open-source Genie components with internal ones by injecting the latter via Spring Boot, without having to change a line of upstream code.

This pattern works well for Genie server, client, and agent CLI, all of which get injected with additional Netflix components for internal use.

===== EC2 instances and Auto Scaling Group (ASG)

The size of a the Genie cluster can be scaled up and down in response to load.

When a new build is deployed, a new ASG is created and the old one disabled.
This allows continuous deployment without any user disruption.

The ASG is set to auto scale when the average amount of used job memory, that 80% of the system memory, exceeds 60% of
the available.

===== Elastic Load Balancer

A TCP https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/[Elastic Load Balancer] (ELB) sits in front of the Genie server instances.
And it is assigned a mnemonic domain name via https://aws.amazon.com/route53/[Route 53] entry.

All clients use this load balancer as single entry point: REST API clients talk HTTPS with a random instance in the cluster, and agents talk gRPC.
The latter is true for both agents launched outside the cluster as CLI-initiated jobs, and agents launched by the cluster itself, in response to a REST API job request.

===== Relational Database (RDS)

We currently use an https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/[Amazon Aurora] cluster.

Our Genie production cluster has a dedicated RDS, while the various test and development clusters share access to a different one.

The RDS only stores job metadata, which often requires strong consistency (e.g., avoid giving the same unique identifier to two jobs) and entities configurations.

===== Zookeeper

We use an https://zookeeper.apache.org/[Apache Zookeeper] cluster for leadership election within our Genie ASG.
The leader only performs background cleanup task for the entire cluster.

Zookeeper is also used for ephemeral routing information (which agent is currently connected to which server instance).

===== S3

Genie relies on S3 to store all data beside job metadata:

 - Job dependencies (binaries, libraries, configuration files, setup scripts, ...)
 - Job outputs and logs archives
 - Job attachments

===== Titus

Each jobs submitted via REST API is launched into its own private https://netflix.github.io/titus/[Titus] container.

The agent running inside the container connects back to the cluster over gRPC via the load balancer.

===== Spinnaker

Genie is deployed using http://www.spinnaker.io/[Spinnaker]. We currently have a few stacks (prod, test, dev, load,
stage, etc) that we use for different purposes. Spinnaker handles all this for us after we configure the pipelines.
See the Spinnaker site for more information.

==== Wrap Up

This section focused on how Genie is deployed within Netflix. Hopefully it helps bring clarity to a way that Genie can
be deployed. Genie certainly is not limited to this deployment model and you are free to come up with your own this
should only serve as a template or example.
