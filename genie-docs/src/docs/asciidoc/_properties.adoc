== Properties

== Genie Web

This section describes the various properties that can be set to control the behavior of your Genie node and cluster.
For more information on Spring properties you should see the
http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/{springBootVersion}/reference/htmlsingle/[Spring Boot] reference documentation and the http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/{springCloudVersion}/[Spring Cloud] documentation.
The Spring properties described here are ones that we have overridden from Spring defaults.

=== Default Properties

==== Genie Properties

Properties marked 'dynamic' reflect change of property value in the environment happening at runtime.
Whereas static properties values are bound during application startup and do not change after the application is up and running.

== Genie Agent

This section describes the various properties that can be set to control the behavior of the Genie agent.

Unless otherwise noted, properties are loaded from the standard sources (defaults, profiles, other files).
The server also has a chance to override them during the 'Agent Configuration' execution stage.

=== Properties forwarding

Server-side properties that match a given prefix are forwarded to all agents during agent configuration stage.
For a property to be forwarded, it needs to be prefixed with `genie.agent.configuration.dynamic.`.

Example:
Set property `genie.agent.configuration.dynamic.genie.agent.runtime.emergency-shutdown-delay` on the server to have it
forwarded to all agents as `genie.agent.runtime.emergency-shutdown-delay`.

|===
|Property |Description |Default Value | Notes

| `genie.agent.runtime.emergency-shutdown-delay`

| Should be lower then `genie.agent.runtime.emergency-shutdown-delay`

| `genie.agent.runtime.heart-beat-service.interval`
| Interval between heartbeats
| 2s
|

| `genie.agent.runtime.heart-beat-service.error-retry-delay`

| How often to check for files limits
| 1m
|

| 30s
| This property is bound during initialization and cannot be modified at runtime by the server.

| `genie.agent.runtime.shutdown.system-executor-leeway`
| Time allowed on task running on Spring's system task executor to complete before the agent terminates
| 60s
| This property is bound during initialization and cannot be modified at runtime by the server.

| `genie.agent.runtime.shutdown.system-scheduler-leeway`
| Time allowed on task running on Spring's system task scheduler to complete before the agent terminates
| 60s
| This property is bound during initialization and cannot be modified at runtime by the server.

== Selector Script Properties

Properties with a special prefix are forwarded to the script selector runtime (with the prefix stripped).

For example, server property `cluster-selector.canary` is passed to the script runtime as `canary`.

|===
|Selector Script | Prefix

| Cluster Selector Script
| `cluster-selector.`

| Command Selector Script
| `command-selector.`

| Agent Launcher Selector Script
| `agent-launcher-selector.`
