== Properties

This section describes the various properties that can be set to control the behavior of your Genie node and cluster.
For more information on Spring properties you should see the
http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/{springBootVersion}/reference/htmlsingle/[Spring Boot] reference documentation
and the http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/{springCloudVersion}/[Spring Cloud] documentation.
The Spring properties described here are ones that we have overridden from Spring defaults.
