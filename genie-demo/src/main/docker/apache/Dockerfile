# TODO: Possiblly we could make these dependency locations of app that point directly to apache. Would make initial
#       Startup slow for first job that executes though...
# NOTE: Doing it using wget instead of ADD because ADD won't use cache layer properly unless BuildKit is enabled
#       and Travis still is on too old a version of docker to enable BuildKit
