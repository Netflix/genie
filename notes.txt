💡 Spring Data REST Events (@RepositoryEventHandler)

https://www.baeldung.com/spring-data-rest-events

@HandleAfterCreate and @HandleAfterSave could intercept.

However save() can generate false positives.
To avoid notifying an event twice, some state must be maintained.

(❓) Entity could save state right after creation and notify if different?
(❓) Entity could provide custom setter that tracks 'dirty' status?

❌ Dead end -- only works with REST-Enabled repositories and on REST calls.
