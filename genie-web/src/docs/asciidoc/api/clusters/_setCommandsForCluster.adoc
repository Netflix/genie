=== Set Commands for a Cluster

==== Description

Set the commands (as array of their ID's) that can run on the cluster.

IMPORTANT: The order of the commands is important. This represents priority order if two commands with same tags match
for the given cluster the one earlier in the list will be selected.

WARNING: The commands for the ID's must already exist in the system
