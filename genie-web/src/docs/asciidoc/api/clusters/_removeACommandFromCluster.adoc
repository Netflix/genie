=== Remove A Single Command From a Cluster

WARNING: Deprecated

NOTE: As of Genie 4.0.0 commands are no longer hard linked to clusters, instead they are dynamically linked by
resolving a command's cluster criteria against the current set of `UP` clusters. This API is now a no-op.

==== Endpoint

`DELETE /api/v3/clusters/{id}/commands/{commandId}`
