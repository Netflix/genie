=== Add Commands to a Cluster

==== Description

Append new commands (as array of their ID's) to the existing list of commands the cluster can run.

IMPORTANT: The order of the commands is important. This represents priority order if two commands with same tags match
for the given cluster the one earlier in the list will be selected.

WARNING: The commands for the ID's must already exist in the system

==== Endpoint

`POST /api/v3/clusters/{id}/commands`
