=== Submit a Job

==== Description

The main API in Genie. Submitting a job to be run.

There are two different ways to submit a job to Genie. Both go to the same endpoint but you can simply send a JSON
payload if you have no attachments. This means setting your content type to `application/json`. If you do have
attachments you want to send with your job request you need to set the content type to `multipart/form-data` and
post the request that way. Examples are below.

==== Endpoint

`POST /api/v3/jobs`

IMPORTANT: The id in this example is optional. If you include one Genie will use it. If not it will provide one. If you
provide one it must be unique.

NOTE: This Example is without attachments
