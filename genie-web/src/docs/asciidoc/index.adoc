== Introduction

This is the REST API documentation for Genie version {revnumber}. Here you will find specific details of how to invoke
the Genie REST API and what you can expect as return values.

NOTE: For more Genie information see the https://netflix.github.io/genie[website].

NOTE: For high level information and installation instructions please see the
https://netflix.github.io/genie/docs/{revnumber}/reference[reference guide].

NOTE: For a demo of this version of Genie please see
https://netflix.github.io/genie/docs/{revnumber}/demo[demo guide].

== Assumptions

This documentation assumes a basic knowledge of how REST APIs work. If you don't know things like HTTP verbs see
websites like http://www.restapitutorial.com/[this] one.

== HATEOAS

A lot of the API's return `application/hal+json` as a content type. This is a superset of JSON built to support
HATEOAS (**H**ypermedia **a**s **t**he **E**ngine **o**f **A**pplication **S**tate). Rather than re-writing what
HATEOAS is see this great write up on the https://spring.io/understanding/HATEOAS[Spring Website] about it.

HATEOAS has several ways to represent the state in return payloads. Genie uses HAL. You can find documentation about
it http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[here] or https://apigility.org/documentation/api-primer/halprimer[here].

== Security

All of this documentation assumes security is disabled for Genie. If your installation has security enabled the REST
APIs will be secured via OAuth2 or x509 certs or both.

NOTE: These are the currently supported API security mechanisms but others could be plugged in. We'll only talk about
OAuth2 here for now until another implementation is done.

=== OAuth2

If OAuth2 is enabled you'll need to send your https://jwt.io/[JWT] you got back from your provider along with your
API request. This is accomplished by setting your `Authorization` header to a value of `Bearer {your token here}`.

=== x509

If your admin has security Genie using client and server certificates mechanisms you'll need to send your client
certificate along with your request.

Something like `curl --cert {your cert} {genie endpoint}`
