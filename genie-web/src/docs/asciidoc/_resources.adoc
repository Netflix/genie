== Resources

This section contains the documentation for various resources sent to and from the various Genie APIs. Note their
structure and fields, particularly what is marked optional. Optional means when you submit one of these resources
to Genie you don't need to set that field. Genie either doesn't require it or if it does, as is the case with ID's,
it will create one if you don't provide it. When you get a resource all fields Genie has stored will be returned.
